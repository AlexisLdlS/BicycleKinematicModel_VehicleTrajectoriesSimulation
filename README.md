# Bicycle Kinematic Model ‚Äì Vehicle Trajectory Simulation

This repository implements the **kinematic bicycle model** in Python, widely used in vehicle dynamics and autonomous driving for trajectory tracking and control validation, and demonstrates its application by generating different trajectories.  
It is a compact project designed to showcase fundamental concepts in **vehicle dynamics, trajectory generation, and control inputs**.

## üöó Model equations
The **kinematic bicycle model** is a simplified representation of a vehicle‚Äôs motion, often used in autonomous driving, robotics, and vehicle dynamics research.  
It captures the relationship between velocity, steering inputs, and vehicle trajectory.

where:
- v: vehicle speed [m/s]
- Œ∏ (theta): heading [rad]
- Œ¥ (delta): steering angle [rad]
- œâ (omega): steering angle rate [rad/s]
- L: wheelbase [m]
- l_r: distance from rear axle to CoG [m]

## üìä Features
This project includes:
- Python class `BicycleModel`  implementing the kinematic bicycle equations with both **steering rate input** and **steering angle input**.
- A script to Simulate of different trajectories:
  - Figure 8
  - Lane change
  - Wave Path
  - Square
- Export of trajectory data (`*.txt`) and trajectory plot (`*.png`).
