# BicycleKinematicModel_VehicleTrajectoriesSimulation
Implemented the kinematic bicycle model using Python OOP to simulate vehicle trajectories.  Designed trajectory inputs (circle, figure-eight, lane change) and validated vehicle dynamics response.Repository serves as base framework for path tracking controllers (Pure Pursuit, Stanley, MPC).
